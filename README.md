# UIO recommended prerequisites

This is a repo for finding the links between uio courses.
It plots a dot for each course in a circle, and links them to their recommended prerequisites.
The plot is interactive, hover over points will highlight courses needed to take it, and courses requiring it. You can also click each course to get the course page.

Feel free to play around with, tough be careful. Everything is quite slow, and this likely wont ever be fixed.
The code is written over the course of 48h, never revised, and an effort was made for norwegian variable names, though no effort was put into variable names in general.
This is to say, it works, and thats about it! No documentation, no well-written code, no great performance, and a few known bugs.

Enjoy!

## How to use

One command-line argument is needed. It is the code for the faculty or institute you want to get the courses of. For instance, if you want all Science courses, write `matnat`. For a specific institute, the faculty is also required, as such `matnat/fys`, for all courses managed by Institute of Physics. `alle/uio` is also a valid command-line argument, and will gather all 3876 courses offered by the University of Oslo. Good luck plotting that :)

You can also in addition provide course-codes as command-line arguments. For example `matnat/fys FYS1120 FYS3150`. This will show the network but only for courses linked with Electromagnetism or Computational Physics. This can be used to show what is needed and what is unlocked for a single course.
